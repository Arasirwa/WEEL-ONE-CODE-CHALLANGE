# WEEK-ONE-CODE-CHALLANGE
in this challage you are requred to come up with solutions for three problems(Toy Problems) as requred by the Canvas course content.
#Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
##PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.
##PROJECT SETUP
This project uses javascript to generate the students grade after the user inputs the individual subject marks.It calculates the total marks and converts the marks into percantage, after which the grades are allocated according to the student's calculated percentage.A passmrk is also included where a student gets a pass or fail depending on score.

#Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
##PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
##PROJECT SETUP
This projects impliments javascript solution to prompt the user wheather the driver is overspeeding and the maximum demerit points incured where is surpassed, the licence is suspended
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
#Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
##PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
